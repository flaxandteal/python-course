Firstly, you can see the tight coupling between printing and analysis - if the printing was handled by a separate class, the interdependency would be clearer, and the responsibility of StatisticalAnalyzer to return a consistent format would be highlighted. As it is, a change to the analysis requires a change to the outputting system, but perhaps this isn't obvious.\n",

Also notice that we have used `abc`, a Python built-in module for strongly enforcing abstract methods. This isn't as common as it could be, as Python is focused on encouraging try-except in consumer functions, rather than assuming functionality is available up front (the main reason for adding an interface). However, if you are building a system that will be extensible but needs to implement certain subclasses, absolutely essentially, then `abc` is a good way of enforcing that. Unfortunately, the exception will only be raised when the subclass is instantiated, but that's slightly better than waiting until the missing method is called!"
