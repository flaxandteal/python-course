    "So what might we want to do with that? Well, the consumer price index (CPI) gives us a way to adjust for inflation. Basically, it says £4.42 in 1948 would buy you the same amount of basic goods as £111.28 in 2009. So we can use this to turn our inflation-adjusted values back into non-inflation-adjusted values - we divide by the CPI. To make it a bit clearer, if we say £55bn was spent on Food in 1971, *in today's money* then we can say (approximately) $$ \\unicode{163}55\\mathrm{bn} \\times \\frac{CPI_{1971}}{CPI_{today}}$$ was spent in 1971-money. Ideally, if you looked up some government record from 1971, the first year of decimal UK currency, and it said \"Ye Olde Expenditure for This Yeare of the HouseHoldes on the Foods and Stuffe of Similar Likeness\", then that should be about the number it says. Please note, 1971 isn't that long ago - I'm just about in that generation, so it's not allowed to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if you find this mysterious, you can just use the formula like any other mysterious statistical formula - this isn't a maths course, we just need it for sensibly coding the analysis!"

    "So looking at the final output, what do we see? In all cases, expenditure rises in absolute terms. The UK spends more on everything in absolute terms, year on year. However, with Communication, we see it is growing exponentially, with Alcohol &amp; Tobacco it is logarithmic or maybe even moving towards a steady limit. The inflation-adjusted values in blue are even more emphatic. Communication still seems to be at least polynomial, although the jumps decrease since the early 2000s. Food is on a gradual linear increase, but pretty consistent. Alcohol &amp; Tobacco fell in relative spending terms from 1971, but since the early 2000s has been fairly static.\n",

    "A side note on big data: some tasks like MapReduce, and other buzzwordy things engineers like me don't deal with much, have specialized non-Python tools you may want to use, but Python is the best tool for analysing the output and passing to something else. Maybe you just have a series of bash scripts, or another tool for generating data. If this sounds like a use-case for you, you may wish to check out [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), an open source Python-based pipeline management tool from Spotify."

    "Another tip if you need your Python fast - you can use Cython to translate it from Python to C and compile it automatically. This is common in science and data analysis for accelerating your Python code. If you're proficient in C then, when you start getting that way in Python, you could check out something like Philip Herron's book *Learning Cython* - he is a Belfast-based developer who has used these tools working for the New York Stock Exchange."
