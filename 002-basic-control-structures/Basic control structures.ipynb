    "There are a couple of things here to dissect. Many languages need braces `{}`, brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` to draw boundaries around the argument of the `if` statement, or the body. In Python, symbols are reduced in favour of words and spaces, for readability. To achieve the same effect, Python separates the condition from the body with the colon `:` and the indentation (four spaces, by convention)\n",

    "However, indentation (whitespace at the start of a line) does. It is an extremely visually clear way to show where blocks of code, like the body of this `if` statement, start and end. For scientists, it forces a very good programming practice - basic code style - your code doesn't run without if it isn't visually clear (well... neatly indented). One of the reasons I got into Python was that my PhD C++ code was so unreadable, dodgily indented and unwieldy, it was easier to rewrite in Python than try and extend it - once I had modification was easy, I could see how everything was laid out, where functions started and ended, before even reading a character.\n",

    "Another thing to note is that you can print with `print`. Here we are running Python3, the latest version. If you've played with Python2, you will notice this syntax is a bit different - it has parentheses (aka. parens) around the argument. A whole raft of changes came in with Python3 and, like Windows XP, Python2 has stayed around for a long time through sheer momentum. However it has long reached end-of-life, so you should make sure to develop new software for Python3. Good porting tools exist for moving old code and, if required, you can write code that will work in both.\n",

This is on the basis that, if you're playing the sport, then you've decided you're there with the ethos, and the players can sort out those decisions amongst themselves and get on with the game. If you're trying to take advantage of that, then the fundamental question is, why play Ultimate Frisbee?"

The upshot of all this is that, when you come to what the community considers \"good code\", it is simple, elegant and clear."
