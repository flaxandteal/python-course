    "There are a couple of things here to dissect. Many languages need braces `{}`, brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` to draw boundaries around the argument of the `if` statement, or the body. In Python, symbols are reduced in favour of words and spaces, for readability. To achieve the same effect, Python separates the condition from the body with the colon `:` and the indentation (four spaces, by convention)\n",

    "However, indentation (whitespace at the start of a line) does. It is an extremely visually clear way to show where blocks of code, like the body of this `if` statement, start and end. For scientists, it forces a very good programming practice - basic code style - your code doesn't run without if it isn't visually clear (well... neatly indented). One of the reasons I got into Python was that my PhD C++ code was so unreadable, dodgily indented and unweildy, it was easier to rewrite in Python than try and extend it - once I had modification was easy, I could see how everything was laid out, where functions started and ended, before even reading a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that you can print with `print`. Here we are running Python3, the latest version. If you've played with Python2, you will notice this syntax is a bit different - it has parentheses (aka. parens) around the argument. A whole raft of changes came in with Python3 and, like XP, Python2 will be around for some time to come through sheer momentum. However by 2016, almost all important libraries are now Python3-ready and I, for one, develop new software in Python3 only, where possible. Good porting tools exist for moving old code.\n",

If you want to get an integer (that is, whatever the float answer is with the decimal chopped off), you can use double-slash. Try removing the second slash and re-running to see the exact non-integer answer. In Python2, using one slash *always* gives an integer, unless you cast the bottom or top to a float (as in C, say)."

It is an important concept to get to grips with, but for the moment, we will keep it fairly functional. Do take time to look through it later - Python is an excellent language for playing around with it and getting an intuition for what an object is. A number of you will be very familiar with this so please bear with me and the very rough introductory description I will give - for those who are not so familiar, this is worth getting the basics down early.\n",

    "In real life, everything has properties, and many things have things they can do. In Python these properties are called attributes and the things an object can do are called methods. Together these are called members and, in Python, are accessed by putting a dot after the object and the attribute or method name. Everything else is just like any other variable or function, respectively.\n",

    "For instance, my dog Freddie has properties - he has a colour, which is black (technically, he is imaginary, but in my head he is definitely black). In Python terms, this would be:"

It indicates that they will have a colour and that they have a method called `shake_paw`. Think of this from the perspective of the dog - the first argument, `self`, is a little Python magic that refers to the dog itself. This lets the dog use it's name and colour (and any other methods) in the `shake_paw` method. The second argument is which paw I told my dog to shake. In response, any dog of mine says \"Shaking left/right paw like a good dog\". That's quite impressive, but I'd rather they just learned to zip it and actually shake their paws instead."

Python denotes somewhat magic functions with double-underscores on either side (they are all the previous items I'm hiding away) - there is good reason for these being here, but they aren't essential just now.
