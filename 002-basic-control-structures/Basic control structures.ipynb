    "There are a couple of things here to dissect. Many languages need braces `{}`, brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` to draw boundaries around the argument of the `if` statement, or the body. In Python, symbols are reduced in favour of words and spaces, for readability. To achieve the same effect, Python separates the condition from the body with the colon `:` and the indentation (four spaces, by convention)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "and it's the same as\n",
    "\n",
    "`Out[2] / 2 = x:`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, indentation (whitespace at the start of a line) does. It is an extremely visually clear way to show where blocks of code, like the body of this `if` statement, start and end. For scientists, it forces a very good programming practice - basic code style - your code doesn't run without if it isn't visually clear (well... neatly indented). One of the reasons I got into Python was that my PhD C++ code was so unreadable, dodgily indented and unwieldy, it was easier to rewrite in Python than try and extend it - once I had modification was easy, I could see how everything was laid out, where functions started and ended, before even reading a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that you can print with `print`. Here we are running Python3, the latest version. If you've played with Python2, you will notice this syntax is a bit different - it has parentheses (aka. parens) around the argument. A whole raft of changes came in with Python3 and, like Windows XP, Python2 has stayed around for a long time through sheer momentum. However it is about to reach end-of-life, so you should make sure to develop new software for Python3. Good porting tools exist for moving old code and, if required, you can write code that will work in both.\n",
